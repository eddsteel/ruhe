# ruhe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddsteel/ruhe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eddsteel/ruhe)


## Slice 0
scala.js + canvas + randomly spaced lines

## Slice 1
lines moving at random speeds
base everything off a single seed value -- to allow reproduction
random number of trees
Tree has starting position and speed
position is derived from speed and time -- allows time to move
make all the tree state 0..1

## Slice 2
Random speeds used to determine saturation/layer index (overlap should work
distance/layer is derived from speed

## Slice 3
add some different thicknesses
random thickness but window gets bigger the closer the tree is

## Slice 4
add some different colours
